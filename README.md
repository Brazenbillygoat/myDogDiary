# myDogsDiary
My dog deserves outlet too.

## Purpose
I wanted a fun space to play with code but I didn't just want to have an empty file. So I decided to write a diary as if it was my dog's. Everything is fictional, I mean obviously but the dates are made up too. I'm not waiting a week to make another entry, I'll make them back to back.


### Index.js
Right now I am thinking I would like this file to be able to search through all the entries in the dog_diary.txt file given a date and output the entry or entries closest to that date.
